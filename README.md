# **Computer Vision with PyTorch**
## This repo stores all the Code for all the projects of the course-series : [Computer Vision with PyTorch on Cognitive Class - IBM](https://cognitiveclass.ai/learn/computer-vision-hands-on-with-pytorch)

### [Project 1](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/course-v1:IBM+GPXX0A52EN+v1) : **Creating anime characters using DCGANs and PyTorch** || _Intermediate | Guided Project | AI_
- GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks that can generate new and realistic images that appear authentic to human observers. By combining GANs with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the process of generating images can be further enhanced, resulting in what is known as Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs).
- **Objective**: Train a DCGAN model using existing character data in order to produce a large number of unique anime character avatars for a video game.
- **Outcomes**
  - Understanding the fundamentals of GANs
  - Implementing GANs on datasets
  - Knowing how to train DCGANs
  - Generating a large quantity of unique images using DCGANs
  - Understanding the impact of changing the input of the latent space on the generated images
